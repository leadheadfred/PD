Strengths: codings gone well

Weaknesses: easily distracted, some theory goes in one ear and out the other

Skills: 

Problems: Easier to get distracted at home, but also easier to work on things im stuck on

Achievements: Getting somewhere with selenium

Happy wit hthe challenge of selenium, but also unhappy cause documentation seems not so good, or im missing something there

Solutions: idk

To revise: SDLC, ISTQB defintions, agile, STLC

Spent most of this fiddling with code so not too much :(
